Me: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
Me: And sorry I could not travel both
Me: And be one traveler, long I stood
Me: And looked down one as far as I could
Me: To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Me: Then took the other, as just as fair,
Me: And having perhaps the better claim,
Me: Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Me: Though as for that the passing there
Me: Had worn them really about the same,

Me: And both that morning equally lay
Me: In leaves no step had trodden black.
Me: Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Me: Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
Me: I doubted if I should ever come back.

Me: I shall be telling this with a sigh
Me: Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Me: Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
Me: I took the one less traveled by,
Me: And that has made all the difference.
