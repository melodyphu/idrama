Speaker 1: Files uploaded to iDrama must be text files.
Speaker 2: Each new line in the file will be treated as a new line in the file. You can create a new line by clicking the "enter" key. 
Speaker 1: Even if a line runs over onto the next, unless you specifically indicate that it is a new line by clicking "enter", it will be treated as part of the previous line. For example, this is still part of line 3.
Speaker 2: You can indicate a speaker by typing their name at the begging of a line and adding a colon ( : ) after. 
Speaker 2: iDrama will search each new line for a speaker, so you must assign a speaker to each line even if it is the same speaker as the previous line.
Speaker 1: A speaker's name will be saved as every character up until the first colon ( : ) in the line. Speaker names cannot contain colons.
Speaker 2: iDrama will detect and keep track of how many speakers are in a file up to two (2) speakers.
Speaker 1: In this file there are two speakers: me, Speaker 1, and Speaker 2.
Speaker 2: You will be able to assign speaker parts to yourself and iDrama.
Speaker 1: You've reached the end of the iDrama file formatting instructions!
Speaker 2: I'd score this performance a 10 out of 10.
